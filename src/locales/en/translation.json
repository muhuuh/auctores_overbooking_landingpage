      {
        "question": "What exactly does Smart Overbooking optimize?",
        "answer": "Auctores’ proprietary ML predicts same-day cancels/no-shows and recommends the optimal overbooking level per date and room type. It’s OTA-aware (different cancellation patterns by channel) and adapts to live demand."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you avoid walkouts or guest friction?",
        "answer": "Safety by design: default no-walk policy, upgrade fallback rules, and VIP/family room protection. You can cap levels per date/room type, add buffers for events/groups, and pause with an instant off switch. All changes are logged."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cap or override recommendations?",
        "answer": "Yes. Set global and date/room-type caps, switch to conservative mode when needed, and apply manual overrides at any time. Overrides are respected and recorded in the audit log."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if the model is wrong?",
        "answer": "Guardrails prevent worst-case outcomes (e.g., walkouts). When confidence is low we default to conservative recommendations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How fast is setup and when do results start?",
        "answer": "Setup takes minutes: connect PMS, set guardrails, activate. Impact begins with the next booking wave—no PMS changes required."
      }
    ],
    "privacyFaqs": [
      {
        "question": "GDPR roles & data location — are you controller or processor and where is data stored?",
        "answer": "We act as controller for your account/profile/authentication and essential service logs, and as processor for data accessed from connected tools (e.g., PMS) to optimize overbooking/automations. We target EU regions for processing and storage; if transfers outside the EEA/UK are unavoidable we rely on SCCs with appropriate safeguards."
      },
      {
        "question": "What personal data do you process, how long do you keep it, and how can users exercise their rights?",
        "answer": "We minimize PII: account/contact details, connector metadata and encrypted access tokens, and limited operational records from the PMS required to provide the service. Connector credentials persist while a connection is active and are deleted on disconnection or account deletion. Minimal operational logs are retained up to ~90 days for security/troubleshooting unless law requires longer. To exercise access/rectification/erasure/restriction/portability/objection, email valentin@auctores.ai."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are secrets and infrastructure protected? What’s your incident approach?",
        "answer": "User secrets are KMS-encrypted at rest and decrypted only to perform authorized API calls; database storage is encrypted with RBAC and RLS. System secrets are managed in a secrets manager with least-privilege IAM and audit logging. Transport is TLS 1.2+, infra is isolated with monitoring and access logging, and we maintain audit trails and an incident response process."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you train models on our data? Can we bring our own/self-hosted LLM?",
        "answer": "We do not train models on your guest PII. Overbooking optimization uses our proprietary ML on operational signals; LLMs (if used) power workflows/explanations. You can bring your own/self-hosted LLM or use our EU setup."
